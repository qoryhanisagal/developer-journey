# Assignment: A Funny Story - Developer's Journey

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript's `let`, `const`, and `console.log` to create a humorous and imaginative story. The story is flexible and allows variables to be adjusted to generate different versions, adding creativity and humor to a developer's journey.

## Objective
Use variables and constants in JavaScript to craft a funny and relatable story that resonates with developers. Each version of the story will be output to the browser's or terminal console.

## Steps
1. **Create the Project Structure:**
    - Create a folder named `fsdi__103` inside `sdgku__work` on my local machine.
   - Create a new HTML file: `assignment1.html`.
   - Create a new JavaScript file: `assignment1.js`.

2. **Build the Story Template:**
   - Use `let` and `const` to declare variables such as character names, actions, and objects.
   - Assign values to these variables to complete the story.
   - Use `console.log` to display the story in the browser's console.

3. **Experiment with Variables:**
   - Change the values of the variables to create different versions of the story.
   - Output each version of the story using `console.log`.

4. **Test in the Browser:**
   - Open the `assignment1.html` file in your browser.
   - Check the browser's console to view the output.
